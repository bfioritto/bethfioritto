Logos. 

Let's be real—I know you've been to Target and wondered what was up with that logo. Did they really pay someone good money to design a circle and a dot? And I'm sure you've seen those redesigns of major brands that cost millions of dollars that people love to hate. And if you've been around a startup (or even just watched Silicon Valley) you know how silly a logo can be for a non-existent product. 

So what value does a company really get out of its logo? Does a it even matter? The answer is, <i>it depends.</i> But first you need to understand what a logo is supposed to do. Which is—<i>what,</i> exactly?

 
<h2>A logo is a symbol for your company.</h2>
 
Let’s unpack that a bit.
 
Customers familiar with your company have thoughts and feelings about it. They know they always get friendly service at your coffee shop and the scones are delicious. Or that when they bring their car to your repair shop, you’re going to be straight with them about what needs to get fixed, and explain it to them in a way they understand. Or when they fly a certain airline, they might have to give up their seat or else get beaten. These impressions people have of your company is what the cool kids call <i>your brand.</i> 
 
Your customer knows what you do, and they have opinions about your company.

At the end of the day, all your logo really needs to be is a symbol that they associate with your company. <b>They give the logo meaning with what they already know.</b>
 
Famous logo designer Paul Rand put it this way: “A logo derives its meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around. A logo is <i>less</i> important than the product it signifies; what it <i>means</i> is more important than what it looks like.”
 
Does this mean a logo has no meaning at all? Definitely not. 
 
A good logo can communicate many things to customers (and prospective customers). 
 
Here are just a few ways it can do that:

<ul>
<li>• depicting something related to your core business. (Duh.)</li>
<li>• how trendy (or not) the logo is</li>
<li>• level of abstraction of the design</li>
<li>• color choice</li>
<li>• type choice</li>
<li>• style of linework</li>
<li>• quality of the craftsmanship</li>
</ul>

Just like we communicate a bit about ourselves through our personal appearance, a logo can do the same thing for a business. And as with our clothing choices, some design choices are positive or negative, while others are more about resonating with who we are on the inside. 
 
<h2>Logos should reflect the “personality” of the business.</h2>
 
(show two companies who do the same thing but market themselves totally differently: trader joes and some shmancy specialty foods store. Caption: both these places sell food, and even have significant overlap in products, but we all know which store’s employees wear hawaiian shirts.)
 
Do you wear a three piece suit to work? Your logo needs to be the equivalent. Pride yourself on creating a cozy atmosphere in your cafe? Your logo should reflect that. 
 
A logo is often the first impression your business makes—it needs to be a good one, and <b>it needs to be consistent with what a customer will experience in doing business with your company.</b>
 
When that first impression and the later experience match, you’re capitalizing on a psychological phenomenon known as confirmation bias. Here’s the gist of it: When we see something new, we try to make sense of it by developing a theory about it. Then, we look for evidence that supports our theory. We actually <i>prime ourselves</i> to look for things that confirm our theory.
 
Here’s how it works with a logo:
(make a little comic or some kind of graphic)
-customer sees logo. It’s visually communicating the vibes you are putting out into the world, attracting the attention of person who digs those vibes. “That looks interesting.”
-customer is now telling themselves a story about your company. “I bet their ice cream tastes just like grandma used to make!”
-that person walks into your shop (or website, or however you do biz). Customer experience matches the story they have been telling themselves, which provides evidence for their theory that they will like what you’re offering. “I knew this place was gonna be great!”
-you create a feedback loop of happiness in your customer’s brain. :-)
 
Contrast that with a mismatch between the logo and the real experience: entice people with a logo that doesn’t match what they’re getting, and you’ll lose their trust, or at the very least keep them guessing (which probably doesn’t lead to sales for your biz). 
 
<h2>Great logos have quality execution.</h2>
 
Your logo—good, bad, or ugly—is communicating <i>something</i> to your customers (and just as importantly, to prospective customers—it may be the only thing they know about your company). It’s your company’s first impression: a handshake, a smile, a classy suit. It’s part of how you show customers you’re professional and take pride in your work. 

Could you hire someone on fivver to throw something together in Illustrator? Sure. But what will that logo tell the world about your business? Think about buying a suit: suits come at a wide variety of price points, but I’m sure you can tell the difference between a cheap suit and a bespoke one. 
 
But it goes beyond aesthetics and quality construction—<b>logos are not teeny art projects to be gazed upon and admired.</b> A good designer considers how and where your logo will be used—what sizes? Over photographs? In color? In print? Online? As a profile image on instagram? And they take these requirements into consideration when crafting a logo.
 
(Show examples of good and bad logo execution and show how professional design makes it better. If possible show graphically similar logos working well and not well). 
 
<h2>An effective logo is not just a logo.</h2>
 
It is also the ways in which it is used. Your logo, the colors, the typefaces, the ways your logo gets applied in various contexts—this is called a visual identity or brand identity. In many ways, this is even <i>more</i> important than the logo itself. The same thought process behind a good logo also applies to the rest of the visual identity. 
 
<h2>When do you not need a logo?</h2>
 
Marc Hemeon wrote a popular piece on <a href="https://journal.designinc.com/how-to-make-a-logo-for-free-in-about-5-minutes-a4f409176a8e">creating a DIY logo in five minutes</a>, and while designers have argued over whether he is devaluing design, he makes a great point about who actually <i>doesn't</i> need a logo. If you don’t have any money coming in, or you don’t know what your product is, you’re probably not ready for a logo. Focus on your product, not on playing "business"—not only to generate revenue, but also because <b>creating a logo requires you to know your core business really well.</b> The meaning of the logo comes from your product or company, not the other way around.
 
<h2>Ask yourself: what do you hope your logo will accomplish?</h2>

Your logo is more than just a pretty face: it’s got a job to do. It’s not going to just sit by the pool and drink mai-tais all day. (If it is, you should fire it.)
 
Before you spend so much as a dime on a logo, you should ask yourself what you want your logo to do for your business. Go ahead, I’ll wait.
 
I’ll bet you said something about looking professional, or using a logo to create marketing materials. My guess is that most of the things you thought of involve how you want your company to be perceived.

So does your logo really matter? Definitely. Creating a logo is an investment in your business, and you should evaluate it in those terms. But it matters <i>less</i> than what your business <i>does.</i> 

Because it doesn't mean anything without that.
