       <h3>Swift Kick</h3>

       <div class="text">
    	   <p>Consultant and Trainer Kevin Griffin wanted to expand his business, and his previous moniker—<i>Kevin Griffin Consulting</i>—no longer made sense for the goals and direction of his business. Swift Kick provides software training, and Kevin wanted a logo that mirrored his approach to training: approachable but no-nonsense—a gentle kick in the pants to get professionals’ skills up to speed. The tongue-in-cheek, illustrative logo communicates the ethos of Swift Kick and also visually sets it apart from other training companies.</p>

		     <p>In addition to the logo, I provided a brand “starter kit” for Swift Kick by specifying colors and type choices to help the client maintain consistency across products, marketing materials, and website.</p>
